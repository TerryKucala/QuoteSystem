# QuoteSystem
Quote system created for my software engineering course at NIU. As a group we utilized Python, Flask, Jinja, Bootstrap, and SQLite.


In order to be ran on a local machine you must have python installed and then using the following commands:
<br>
python -m venv env
<br>
pip install -r requirements.txt
<br>
pip install Flask-Mail
